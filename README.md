# ðŸ§  SQL Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my SQL Projects Repository! This collection showcases my work with structured data using SQL across a variety of real-world and practice datasets. It includes queries for data analysis, transformation, and exploration, all organized by project.

## ðŸ“Œ About This Repository

This repo is a personal portfolio of SQL-based data projects designed for:
- Demonstrating proficiency in SQL (joins, aggregations, subqueries, CTEs, window functions, etc.)
- Exploring different data scenarios (sales, users, finance, etc.)
- Sharing reusable queries for learning or production inspiration

Feel free to explore, reuse, or adapt the code for your own projects.
